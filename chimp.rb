# This is a translation of an example application from

# The original application had this to say:
# 
#   This simple example is used for the line-by-line tutorial
#   that comes with pygame. It is based on a 'popular' web banner.
#   Note there are comments here, but for the full explanation, 
#   follow along in the tutorial.
# 
# The original tutorial could be found at this location as of 2005-04-17:
# 
#   http://pygame.org/docs/tut/chimp/ChimpLineByLine.html
# 
# As much as possible, this is a straight port of the pygame example,
# without any real improvements in style. Significant deviations are
# noted by comments. As such, this might serve as something of a
# Rosetta Stone for a pygame user switching to Rubygame.
