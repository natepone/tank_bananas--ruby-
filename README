I copied chimp.rb from rubygames.org then modified it for practice.

So far, I have made the game fullscreen, and the Apache flies in 2D. I replaced the .bmps, and added flying bananas, which will eventually be fired from the tank. I included the original chimp.rb from Rubygames.org for comparison purposes.
